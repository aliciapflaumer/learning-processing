Processing is an open-source object-oriented programming language in the context of visual arts.

This repo is a place for me to store the exercises as I work through Daniel Shiffman's book 'Learning Processing.'

The website for the book is [here](http://learningprocessing.com/).

You can also learn more about Processing [here](https://processing.org/).
